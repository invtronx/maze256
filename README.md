# maze256

The Arduino/C++ portion of the maze project for CICS 256. We were unable to finish our entire project, i.e., building a full-blown maze game with controls
such as joysticks and an LCD display. As such, the code for these controls is incomplete, but the overall structure is discernible. The overview of the
game along with the videos of the working hardware can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/maze256/home.
